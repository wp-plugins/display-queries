Display Plugin for number of queries and page loading time

== Description ==

This plugin shows the admin at the bottom of the template the number of queries and the page loading time of the displayed page.

The display will be shown at the lower border of the current template and is only visible for admins (userlevel >=8)

With it you can check after the installation of a new template or plugin the load speed of your blog and the number of queries it makes to the database (check the database load)

Therefore you can see and disable templates and / or plugins that make a huge load on your database and thus disable them and optimize this way the speed of your wordpress installation.

For the display there are no changes necessary on your current template, it will just be displayed in the footer of the blog page.

Additionally there will be 2 buttons displayed of the validators from the w3c sites, so when you click those  you can check your template if the HTML and CSS parts are valid and compliant with the W3C rules.

= Will I have to configure the plugin ? =

No, for the display of the queries and load time there will be no changes necessary.

= There is no display although the plugin is activated ? =

Probably the hook "wp_footer" was not included in your template file.
Please write to the template author and request it to be included and maybe there is already a new version of your template out ?
Always install the newest template version first and check again.
